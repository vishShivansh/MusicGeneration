[Intro]
Underneath the moonlit sky,
In the gentle, softest sighs,
A melody whispers goodbye,
To the day, to the endless lies.

[Verse 1]
Guitar strings sing a story old,
Of love lost and time uncontrolled,
Whispers echo through the fold,
In the quiet of the falling cold.

[Chorus]
In this acoustic ballad, we hold,
Memories that time can't unfold,
In the rhythm of our souls untold,
Together, our hearts are softly told.

[Verse 2]
Soft notes resonate through the air,
Like a lullaby playing fair,
In the silence, our feelings bear,
A connection that's ever so rare.

[Chorus]
In this acoustic ballad, we hold,
Memories that time can't unfold,
In the rhythm of our souls untold,
Together, our hearts are softly told.

[Bridge]
With each strum, a new verse unfolds,
Revealing truths that often go unsaid,
In the music, we find our own bold,
A language that speaks without a word.

[Verse 3]
The melody takes us back in time,
To moments shared, a shared rhyme,
In the echoes of our whispered sign,
We find solace, in love's sweet chime.

[Chorus]
In this acoustic ballad, we hold,
Memories that time can't unfold,
In the rhythm of our souls untold,
Together, our hearts are softly told.

[Outro]
As the final chord gently rings,
In our hearts, the song remains,
A timeless ballad, forever flings,
Our love, forever in a gentle strain.

[Intro]
In the gentle sway of the evening breeze,
The world seems to pause, a peaceful ease.
Under the moonlight, stars whisper to trees,
A symphony of calmness, a soothing melody.

[Verse 1]
I sit by the fire, holding a guitar,
Strumming the strings, letting emotions unravel.
The chords resonate with memories of you,
Echoing softly, like a lullaby from the blue.

[Chorus]
In this acoustic ballad, my heart takes flight,
Through the notes, I speak, my soul's true sight.
With every strum, I feel your presence tight,
In this moment, time seems to drift.

[Verse 2]
As the firelight dances, casting shadows around,
My thoughts wander back to those golden afternoons.
When we shared stories, under the same moon,
Our laughter filled the air, like a sweet tune.

[Chorus]
In this acoustic ballad, my heart takes flight,
Through the notes, I speak, my soul's true sight.
With every strum, I feel your presence tight,
In this moment, time seems to drift.

Each chord, a memory, each note, a sigh,
In this melody, I see us, as we used to be.
In the quietness, our love still holds sway,
In this acoustic ballad, forever it stays.

[Verse 3]
Now, as the night falls, and the stars start to blink,
I play on, letting the music take its link.
To the past, present, and future we'll think,
In this acoustic ballad, our love will still ring.

[Chorus]
In this acoustic ballad, my heart takes flight,
Through the notes, I speak, my soul's true sight.
With every strum, I feel your presence tight,
In this moment, time seems to drift.

[Outro]
And when the last note fades into silence,
I'll hold onto the melody, the love that's been decided.
In this acoustic ballad, our story will compile,
Forever etched in the memories, like a timeless style.

Neon lights they flicker bright
City hums in dead of night
Rhythms pulse through concrete veins
Lost in echoes of refrains

Electric whispers fill the air
Synthesized dreams everywhere

Feel the fire let it grow
In this rhythm we belong
Hear the night sing out our song

Wake the soul from silent sleep
Every note a story told
In this night we're bold and gold

Soulful shouts beneath the skies

[Intro]
Ancient tales from the land of Indus
Where the sacred river flows
Lord Krishna, the divine wonder
His story, forever aglow

[Verse 1]
Born in a humble abode
In a kingdom of cows and gods
A child with a playful soul
His flute echoes through the golden pole

[Bridge]
Golden dreams under the milky way
Where love dances in every sway
Krishna, the divine lover
His heart beats for the Ganga river

[Verse 2]
Leaves rustle as he walks
Through forests of love and talks
With his friends, the playful cowherds
Their laughter, a melody to be heard

[Chorus]
Oh, Lord Krishna, the divine son
Your love, a celestial bond
In your dance, the universe is won
Krishna, our eternal guide, you've shown

[Verse 3]
On the banks of Yamuna, you play
Your flute's sweet notes, a divine display
Lila, the pastimes of love
Krishna, the embodiment of devotion's dove

[Bridge]
Rivers flow, mountains rise
In your presence, all worries dissolve
Krishna, the eternal lover
In your embrace, all hearts surrender

[Outro]
In the end, it's but a tale
Of a divine soul, who gave it all
Krishna, our eternal friend
Your love, forever in our heart's blend.
